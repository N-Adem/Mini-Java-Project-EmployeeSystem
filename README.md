# Mini-Java-Project-EmployeeSystem
-----------------------------------
####Project Features:
This Project contains a program which tracks Sparta trainees on the various courses.
You are able to manage students by performing CRUD operations.

####Prerequisite:
-IDE: any IDE like IntelliJ, sublime or code is fine though I recommend Eclipse(https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).
     *Note*: To run eclipse you will need a compatible JDK.

-DataBase: You will need to download PostgreSQL for the DB(https://www.postgresql.org/).
     *Note*: I suggest also downloading and setting up PGAdmin(https://www.pgadmin.org/), its a lightweight GUI designed for postgreSQL.

####Setup:
I have provided dummy data (Enter here), which when run will populate the db with data for you to work with.
